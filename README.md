# SMILES-based Molecular Generation Repository

## **Overview**
This repository is designed to develop and experiment with machine learning models for generating and validating molecular structures using SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System). The project employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a SMILES Decoder to create new molecules, focusing on Alzheimer's Disease drug discovery.

## **Workflow**

### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
- Load SMILES datasets (e.g., `FDA_approved_drugs_with_smiles.csv`).
- Validate and clean SMILES strings using RDKit to ensure they represent valid molecules.

### **Step 2: Convert SMILES to Numerical Representations**
- Use RDKit's Morgan fingerprints to convert SMILES into fixed-length numerical arrays.

### **Step 3: Train the Models**
- Train the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to:
  - Encode molecular data into a latent space.
  - Reconstruct molecules from the latent space.
- Train the SMILES Decoder to:
  - Generate valid SMILES strings from latent representations.

### **Step 4: Generate New Molecules**
- Use the trained VAE and Decoder to sample the latent space and generate new molecular structures in SMILES format.

### **Step 5: Validate and Visualize**
- Validate the generated SMILES strings to ensure they represent valid molecules.
- Convert SMILES strings to images using `smile_to_img.py` for easier visualization.

## **How to Run**

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install all required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Main Script**
   - Train models, preprocess data, and generate new SMILES:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Use Pre-trained Models**
   - Skip training by loading the pre-trained weights:
     - `vae_model.pth`
     - `smiles_decoder.pth`

4. **Generate New Molecules**
   - Modify `main.py` to sample latent space and generate new SMILES.

## **Limitations and Future Work**

### **Current Limitations**
- Generated SMILES - not always represent valid molecules.
- Limited by the quality and size of the training dataset.
- Basic model architecture may struggle with highly complex molecular structures.

### **Future Improvements**
- Incorporate larger, more diverse datasets for training.
- Use advanced model architectures like MegaMolBART or ChemBERTa.
- Implement stricter validation techniques to ensure the generation of chemically meaningful molecules.

## **Applications**
While this project demonstrates drug discovery for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, the same framework can be extended to:
- Discover treatments for other diseases.
- Explore new materials or biologically active compounds.

By refining this workflow, we aim to accelerate drug development and reduce costs, making it accessible for small pharmaceutical companies.
